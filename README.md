# Robotics Tasks

This repository contains the code and resources for various robotics tasks implemented in Gazebo simulation ðŸ¤– using the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework on Linux.

## Task List

1. Wanderer Robot
    - Description: Implementation of a simple wanderer robot capable of autonomous navigation in an environment.
    - Files:
        - `wanderer.py`: Main program file for the wanderer robot.
        - `scan_around.launch`: Laser Range Finder Application.
        - ...

2. Wall Follower Robot
    - Description: Implementation of a robot capable of following walls or obstacles in its surroundings.
    - Files:
        - `wall_follower.py`: Main program file for the wall follower robot.
        - ...
3. Publisher Subscriber
    - Description: Practice of using multiple nodes in Ghazebo
    - Files:
