Wall following is any algorithm that causes a robot to move along walls without hitting them. Wall following is important for navigating around obstacles and is central to Bug algorithms. In this task, you will use the laser readings to make a moving robot stay in the center of two walls. Create a node named walls.py in the package.
First create an arrangement of two walls by placing numerous cubes (or cylinders) in the simulation. The two walls must NOT be completely straight and must have some curvature. The two walls essentially form a curved corridor. The robot starts from one end of the corridor in between the two walls. When the node is executed, the robot moves to the other end which is barricaded (i.e. itâ€™s a dead end). Upon reaching the end, the robot stops moving.
You need to use the right and left lasers to keep the moving robot in the center as much as possible. The front laser will be needed at the end portion to stop the robot. Do NOT use any teleoperation for this task.
